This repository contains the Violent Presence of Armed Actors in Colombia (ViPAA) 1.4 event database.

ViPAA provides geo-referenced data at the daily municipal level related to the violent presence of armed actors in Colombia between **1988 and 2023**.

The data categorizes armed actors in four main types:

* Government forces
* Insurgent organizations
* Paramilitary groups
* Criminal organizations
* Criminal organizations
* FARC Dissidents

Each of these types of actors is further disaggregated in a multitude of specific organizations.   

ViPAA is generated using computerized text annotation with Eventus ID, a protocol for supervised event coding capable of geo-referencing actors mentioned in text written in Spanish (Osorio & Reyes 2016).

The information used as an input for the computerized coding came from Noche y Niebla, a collection of narratives of human rights violations published by the Centro de Investigación y Educación Popular, CINEP.
